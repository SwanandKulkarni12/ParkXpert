ParkXpert

The Parking Management System is a comprehensive solution that enables users to reserve parking slots online, automates number plate detection upon entry and exit, fetches information from RTO (Regional Transport Office) API to gather details about the vehicle, and calculates parking charges based on entry and exit times. This system integrates web development, machine learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to streamline the parking experience.
